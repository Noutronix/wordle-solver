# wordle-solver

This program is intended to solve any given wordle answer in the least amount of guesses possible. The program functions by taking a squared average of the different outcomes that a guessed word can have (ex: all greys, one green and the rest greys, etc.) to determine which guess will eliminate on average the highest number of words. My program is, at the time of writing (2022-07-21), at x spot on the "wordle bot leaderboard," with an average of x guesses needed to determine the answer. It always uses the word "salet" to begin.
